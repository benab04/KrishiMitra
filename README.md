- **Farm Orchestrator**: Coordinates between different agricultural agents
- **Weather Agent**: Provides weather forecasts and alerts
- **Soil Agent**: Analyzes soil conditions and provides recommendations
- **Pest Agent**: Monitors and suggests pest control measures
- **Market Agent**: Tracks agricultural market prices and trends
- **Satellite Agent**: Processes satellite imagery for crop monitoring
- **Search Agent**: Handles information retrieval tasks
- **Notification Agent**: Manages user alerts and communications

### Frontend (Next.js)

A modern, responsive web interface built with:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components

## Tech Stack
